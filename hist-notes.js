        "Trade from the 16th and 17th centuries has vastly affected the modern world’s structure of economics, namely capitalism. The Columbian exchange, and specifically commerce within early-modern Europe are a huge part of what kickstarted the global economy. Here, you may explore these themes via this interactive map, which highlights the Columbian Exchange and its connection to current day economics.",
        "The Columbian Exchange was kickstarted after Christopher Columbus’ first voyage in 1492, with its most intense phase being from the 15th to 18th centuries. During Columbus’ journey, he studied parts of the Caribbean, namely Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas. He described the land of the Americas as fertile and traverse, which was suitable for livestock and agriculture. His reports fueled trade of resources, plantation agriculture, and slave labor during this start of the Columbian Exchange."],

    "europe-to-americas": ["The main <b>livestock</b> exported from Europe into the Americas/New World were horses, pigs, and cattle. <b>Crops</b> exported included wheat, rye, and various grains. Smallpox was the main <b>disease</b> transferred by Europeans, which greatly harmed native populations."],

    "americas-to-europe": ["The Americas brought many <b>crops</b> which greatly diversified the global diet, namely corn, potatoes, squash, beans, cacao, cassava, and peppers. Tobacco was also a key crop which created a great shift in the economy and inflation in Europe, as well as <b>precious metals</b> (gold, silver). The Americas also brought the <b>disease</b> syphilis."],

    "asia-to-americas": ["Sugar, tea, and rice were the main <b>crops</b> being brought from this region. Unfortunately, along with these exports came plague."],

    "americas-to-africa": ["The same major <b>crops</b> being exported from the Americas into Europe were exported to Africa as well; tobacco, potatoes, corn, and squash were all sent into the American diaspora. Syphilis was also spread. Generally, we see a <b>pattern</b> of new diseases being introduced into the lives of so many through these trade routes."],

    "africa-to-americas": ["Africa brought two significant <b>illnesses</b> to the Americas, malaria and yellow fever. Sugar and rice were also a main export. We see that the Old World (Europe, Asia, and Africa) seem to have limited and very similar resources. Hence, the Columbian Exchange introduced <b>new trade routes and styles of farming</b>."],

    "europe-1700": [
        "<b>European expansion</b> after 1492 and through the 16th century was central to the rise of capitalism, which we see greater effects of within the 17th century. <b>Overland routes/Mediterranean dominated trading</b> made a shift and instead turned to <b>Atlantic and Northern European corridors</b>. New sea routes to the Americas, West Africa, and other parts of Africa to Asia became centralized, in which regional impacts such as the <b>rise of Atlantic-facing powers</b> (e.g., Portugal, Spain, later the Dutch and English) and the relative decline in importance of older overland and Mediterranean routes, especially those controlled by <b>Italian city-states and certain Balkan and Central European</b> intermediaries are seen.",
        "<b>Mercantilism</b> became the dominant economic system and framework in Europe at this time. European governments began to intervene in the economy in order to <b>promote exports, limit imports</b>, and accumulate precious metals. We see a clear similarity between mercantilism and capitalism, in which there is a desire to to maximize wealth and create national power.",
        "Spanish and Portuguese conquest and exploitation of the Americas during the Columbian Exchange sent large amounts of <b>precious metals</b> and <b>plantation profit</b> back to Europe. These wealth flows provided capital which enhanced Europe’s <b>commercial and economic position</b> in comparison to Africa/Asia/Americas. The development of colonial trade during these centuries created global commerce networks where money could circulate, but heightened inflation greatly."],

    "caribbean-1700": [
        "Documentation, such as that of Richard Ligon, who spent time on a <b>500-acre sugar plantation</b> in Barbados from <b>1647</b> until <b>1650</b> gives great insight into the wealth the Americas brought to Europe. Ligon reported a total yearly profit of <b>£8,866</b>, and with the deduction of expenses, a net profit of about <b>£7,516</b>. In his report, he even stated that the amount of money from this plantation seemed to be unbelievable.",
        "Columbus greatly <b>exploited</b> the American land, which we often see now by people in power. European expansion, with a peak in the 17th century, was central to the rise of <b>capitalism</b>. With early <b>state formation</b> occurring during this time as well, we see many parallels to our current society."]
